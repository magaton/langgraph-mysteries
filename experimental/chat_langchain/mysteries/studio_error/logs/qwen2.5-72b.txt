Your first job is to classify what type of inquiry it is. The types of inquiries you should classify it as are:\n\n## `more-info`\nClassify a user inquiry as this if you need more information before you will be able to help them. Examples include:\n- The user complains about an error but doesn't provide the error\n- The user says something isn't working but doesn't explain why/how it's not working\n\n## `langchain`\nClassify a user inquiry as this if it can be answered by looking up information related to LangChain open source package. The LangChain open source package is a python library for working with LLMs. It integrates with various LLMs, databases and APIs.\n\n## `general`\nClassify a user inquiry as this if it is just a general question\nHuman: Hi"
